Project title: Waste an hour having fun

Project description:
	This game is intended as a job application for the Brazilian game developer Cupcake Entertainment. The project itself is a Minimum Viable Product for a rock, paper, scissors game with a cartoon-like appearance and where the player will be able to play a version of the child's passtime of the same name in an electronic version anywhere with an active connection to the Internet or offline if the device being used has all the necessary files.
	The player will be able to play how many rounds he or she wishes without having to reload the game . A counter with the player's number of victories and defeats will be kept on screen until the game is closed, at which point this counter will be reset. It will be possible to play against a computer player or simply watch as two computer players challenge each other, the computer players will always choose between the possible choices of play at the beginning of each match instead of being pre-programmed.

Technical Aspects:
	The game itself is developed using pure JavaScript without the use of any external or third party libraries as its core development language and the assets were created using image editing tools.


Game Flow:
	To start the game, the player will have to either access a static URL with all the assets and files needed already set in the server side or have such files locally inside a folder and open the index.html file, which will start the game in a local Internet browser window. With the game started, the EnchantJS framework will load all the required assets, assuming they are still in the same folder hierarchy as they were when development was taking place, and the game will start when the loading phase is completed.
	The first screen the player will see is a menu with the game's logo telling the player to press any key to continue. Upon doing so, another menu will replace the previous one and offer the player the option to choose which mode should be started: "Player vs. Computer" or "Computer vs. Computer", or to Quit the game.
	After selecting either one of the options in the menu the player will be taken to the game's stage, the only difference being in the first option that the player has the ability to give the game inputs while its computer opponent waits. The stage itself is composed by an area with the player's options of play as buttons, an area representing the oponnent, an area displaying the relevant game information, including a button to stop the matches, and an area where both players' plays will be compared and the result will be given. The result will update the game's information area according to the number of victories or defeats the player had so far and then reset the stage back so another match can be played instantly after.
	When the player presses the option to stop the matches the game will redirect the flow back to the menu with the game's logo and the process may be restart.

Game Mechanics:
	The game's mechanics are simple and the same as its real life equivalent. The player has to choose an option that will win against the one chosen by its opponent, after having picked his choice the player waits for its opponent to pick his and then both choices are shown simmultaneously after which the winner is decided. In order to pick an option to be played the player has to click the corresponding button on screen to select it. The victory conditions are as follows:
	- Rock beats Scissors;
	- Scissors beats Paper;
	- Paper beats Rock;

Assets Needed:
	Code:
	 - Preloader of assets;
	 - Menu Manager - One for each menu, directing the flow of the game correctly;
	 - Game Manager - Contains all the logics and mechanics needed to build the main scene, evaluate its outcomes and show the assets to the player;
	 - Player Manager - Interface for the player to interact with the game containning its actions and stats as well;
	 - Computer Manager - Similar to the Player Manager but dealing with the computer player interface, contains its AI as well;

	2D art:
	 - Game Logo;
	 - Menu UIs;
	 - Game Stage UI;
	 - Buttons for picking the choices;
	 - Textures for showing both options and the resulting winner in the game stage;

Considerations:
 The game has been tested in FireFox Mozilla version 55.0.3 (32 bits);

Possible future add-ons to the Minimum Viable Product:
 - Different player behaviour;
 - Timer for the player to play;
 - Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock (Remember to update the mechanics section);
 - Confirmation screen of the player's choice;

GDD ToDo:
 Create a description/readme in the GitHub repository;
 Review the assets needed;
